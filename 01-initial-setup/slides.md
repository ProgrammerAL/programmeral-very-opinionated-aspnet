# What/Why is this series?

- Have a single sample to show off
- Talk about simpler style choices to ASP.NET Core apps
- I've seen many of the selected topics skipped over by developers or ignored because of ick factor

# Series Goals

* Develop a simple application over time
* Relativly short videos
* Different topic each video
* Some topics will bleed into other weeks
* Simple, Quick and Easy to understand Code
